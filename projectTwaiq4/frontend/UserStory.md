### Website scenario
 The site is about art, drawing, selling paintings, and asking the artist to draw for the customer according to the customer's request
So that my site contains three characters:
1. admin.
2. Client.
3. the painter.

There are three characters from the painters
Painter paints according to customer's request
Painter draws on demand and also sells paintings he drew
And a painter who only draws free drawings and sells his paintings
So that each artist will have his own page where the customer can request a specific drawing or browse and buy his drawings.


The request and communication with the painter will be via WhatsApp so that the customer puts all his information, which are:
1. Set the image to be drawn.
2. Description of the picture or when he wants to end the picture.
3. He also put his number to contact him.

So that the painter receives the request, sees the requests, agrees to them, and communicates with the customer to complete with him the rest of the order details such as price and others

In terms of buying paintings from artists
The customer can choose a painting and how many paintings he wants and complete the purchase, either the payment is online or the payment upon receipt.
