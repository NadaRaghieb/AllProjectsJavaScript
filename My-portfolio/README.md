# Portfolio Project

=================================================
## Description

I created a personal portfolio website using the Reactjs library. I used the useState hook to manage the state of the website, and I added Arabic language support and a dark mode. I also included information about myself, my experience, education, and courses. I added a contact form for people to get in touch with me, and a footer with social media links.

## Here are some of the key features of my portfolio website:
### Reactjs: 
I used Reactjs to create a dynamic and interactive website.
useState hook: I used the useState hook to manage the state of the website, such as the language and dark mode settings.
### Arabic language support:
I added Arabic language support to the website so that it can be accessed by a wider audience.
### Dark mode: 
I added a dark mode to the website so that it can be easier to use in low-light conditions.
### 
About me: I included a section about myself where I talk about my experience, education, and skills.
### Experience: 
I included a section where I list my work experience.
### Education: 
I included a section where I list my education.
### Courses: 
I included a section where I list the courses I have taken.
### Contact form: 
I added a contact form for people to get in touch with me.

### I am very proud of my portfolio website, and I believe that it is a great way to showcase my skills and experience. I am confident that it will help me to get new job opportunities and clients.
